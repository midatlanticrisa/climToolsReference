**Developed By:** EPA

**Summary:** Part of the Creating Resilient Water Utilities Tool (CRWU), the Case Study and Information Exchange provides examples from water utilities that have implemented adaptation measures for natural hazards and water management challenges such as climate change. 

Using an interactive map, users can view a variety of projects designed to address drought, flood, ecosystem changes, service reliability, and/or water quality challenges. Within each category, users will find relevant case studies, each with a brief description of potential utility impacts, the threats addressed, and adaptive measures used. In some cases, additional information is available in the form of a summarized project report or an explanatory YouTube video. The Cast Study and Information Exchange is an ongoing project and communities are encouraged to contribute additional examples of utility adaptation projects.
