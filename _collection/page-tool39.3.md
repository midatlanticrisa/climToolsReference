**Developed By:** Cornell University_College of Agriculture and Life Sciences

**Summary:** Part of the Climate Smart Farming toolkit, the Water Deficit Calculator estimates soil water content within a crop's effective root zone to predict potential water deficits and associated plant stress.  

The Water Deficit Calculator provides site and crop specific estimates of local water deficits for agricultural producers, using historical climate data, short term weather forecasts, and user-provided site information. By providing their location, soil water capacity, crop type, and date of planting/budbreak users can calculate a season-to-date and 30-day outlook of predicted water deficits. Users also have the option to adjust the water deficit calculation by entering their most recent irrigation date. Results are provided through a series of interactive plots that display the observed daily deficits and probability of future deficits over the next 30 days. Each plot also highlights when plant stress is likely based on the observed/predicted water deficits. This tool was designed for agricultural audiences with background knowledge of crop growth and irrigation practices. Although it easy to use, and includes helpful instructions and tutorials for beginner users, subject matter expertise is necessary in order to interpret and apply tool outputs. The tool is still being revised and users are encouraged to provide feedback to the developers.
