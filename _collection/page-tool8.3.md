**Developed By:** EPA

**Summary:** Part of the Creating Resilient Water Utilities Tool (CRWU), the Resilient Strategies Guide is a beginner resource for water utilities working on a preliminary identification of adaptation strategies specific to their needs. 

Through this easy-to-use and iterative tool, users provide basic information about their location, and select priorities, assets, and strategies with which they are concerned. Users can select priorities such as water quality, water demand from different sectors (i.e., agricultural water demand), and/or loss of coastal wetlands. User selections are generated into a final report which summarizes the selected priorities, provides general climate change information for the imputed location, and lists case studies from other water utilities. The final report can be printed or exported to a Climate Resilience Evaluation and Awareness file. In addition to the report, the tool includes an overview in the form of an FAQ about why and how to plan for adaptation strategies, as well as providing information about options and advice for pursuing specific adaptation strategies.
