# Climate Smart Farming: Apple Stage / Freeze Damage Probability

<img src="/images/scaled_250_400/TOOLID_39.5_ScreenCapture-1.png" style="max-height:250px;max-width:400;" align="right"/>

**Developed By:** Cornell University_College of Agriculture and Life Sciences

**Summary:** Part of the Climate Smart Farming toolkit, the Apple Stage/Freeze Probability Tool predicts the potential freeze damage for 3 varieties of apple crops. 

This tool â€œgraphs minimum temperature versus damage probability for the estimated phenological stage at the selected location to produce a graph of past conditions, as well as a 6-day forecast." By providing their location, apple variety, and date of interest, users can view the minimum temperature for their location in comparison to damage temperatures leading to freeze risk. The tool automatically generates a time series plot of temperature (degrees Fahrenheit) over time which can be viewed through a current season or through a 30-day outlook. Having background knowledge of crop growth is useful for using this tool, but beginner users can utilize a series of video tutorials and explanations to become familiar with the features of the tool. The tool is still being revised and users are encouraged to provide feedback to the developers.
