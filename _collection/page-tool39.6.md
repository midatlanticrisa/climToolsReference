## Climate Smart Farming: Grape Hardiness & Freeze Risk

<img src="/images/scaled_250_400/TOOLID_39.6_ScreenCapture-1.png" style="max-height:250px;max-width:400;" align="right"/>

**Developed By:** Cornell University_College of Agriculture and Life Sciences

**Summary:** Part of the Climate Smart Farming toolkit, the Grape Freeze Risk Tool predicts the potential freeze damage for 3 varieties of grapes. 

This tool assesses hardiness temperature across the Northeast in order to inform users of freeze risks to their grape crops. By providing their location, grape variety, and date of interest, users can calculate the minimum temperatures needed for the crop to grow  in comparison to a hardiness temperature. The tool automatically generates a time series plot of temperature (degrees Fahrenheit) over time which can be viewed through a current season or through a 30-day outlook. Having background knowledge of crop growth is useful for using this tool, but beginner users can utilize a series of video tutorials and explanations to become familiar with the features of the tool. The tool is still being revised and users are encouraged to provide feedback to the developers.
