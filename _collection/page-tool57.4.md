**Developed By:** USFS, Davey Tree Expert Company, Arbor Day Foundation, Society of Municipal Arborists, International Society of Arboriculture, Casey Trees, and SUNY_College of Environmental Science and Forestry.

**Summary:** i-Tree HydroPlus is a collection of process-based environmental models including I-Tree Hydro, I-Tree Cool Air, and I-Tree Cool River. It is designed to model 1) the effects of land cover changes on water quantity and quality, and 2) the effects of channel morphology, riparian shading, tributaries, stormwater inflow, groundwater mixing, and river restoration. Though beneficial for specific projects and experts in forestry and land management, i-Tree HydroPlus is not intended for everyday users. i-Tree HydroPlus is a more time intensive and complex tool on i-Tree. It requires a downloadable software application.
