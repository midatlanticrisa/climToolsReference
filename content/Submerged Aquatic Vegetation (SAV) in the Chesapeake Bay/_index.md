#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) in Chesapeake Bay tool provides access to recent and historical SAV monitoring data from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science SAV program. 

This tool allows users to access interactive maps, charts, and tables portraying annual changes in SAV density and distribution throughout the Chesapeake Bay, based on annual field and aerial surveys of SAV dating back to 1971. In the interactive map users can view recent and historical SAV aerial imagery and density, and compare changes in SAV bed distribution over time. This tool also includes annual reports, graphics and images cataloguing changes in SAV over time. Advanced users can download shapefiles or tabular data for a specified time period for further analysis. Users may also contribute data to the tool by submitting detailed observations to an external Aerial and Field SAV Observations site or to the SOS (Save our Seagrass) Facebook page. Throughout the tool, users can find thorough documentation of procedures, resources, and additional reports about SAV in the Bay.

**Relevance:** Warmer temperatures from climate change impact habitat suitability for SAV which in turn affects coastal ecosystem health. Through this tool, users can monitor the health of SAV within a climate context.

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** Federal Agencies, State Agencies, Environmental Planner, Floodplain Managers, Environmental Agencies, Researchers, Conservationists, Environmental Consultant, Natural Resource Professionals, Non-governmental Organizations, Restoration Specialists

**Strengths:** Links to supporting information, Allows user to search by location to view SAV in the interactive map, Option to download raw data, Users can contribute detailed observations or survey data through external site, Allows users to access historic SAV data

**Limitations:** Some links for supporting information invalid, Does not provide projections of future conditions
