#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Exploration and Graphics RivEr Trends (EGRET) is an R package for the analysis of hydrologic data concerning long-term changes in rivers, river flows, and river quality.

EGRET is an tool for advanced users who have experience working with the software R. After downloading EGRET, users can conduct exploratory analyses about water quality and discharge across long-term averages, variability patterns, and temporal trends. The software enables users to acquire data records, process data for analysis, and display findings through various graphical techniques such as plots and graphs. The software accepts data from several government agencies, including US Geological Survey and Environmental Protection Agency, but the dataRetrieval package is required in order to access the data from government agencies. Users can also import their own data through a comma-separated file. Basic information about how to use EGRET and dataRetrieval are available as pdf documents.

**Relevance:** Increased temperatures from climate change will affect river conditions. Through this tool, users can track such impacts on rivers.

**Scope:** Generalized

**Target Audience:** Conservationists, Environmental Agencies, Natural Resource Professionals, Planners, Researchers

**Strengths:** Welcome guide pdf, Sample code provided, Additional resources for locating data provided, Support for trouble-shooting available

**Limitations:** After summer 2019 may experience less package maintenance and customer support, Requires import of additional software packages, Data must be in a specific format
