**Summary:** This open-source version of the Nonpoint Source Pollution and Erosion Comparison Tool is used to investigate potential water quality impacts from climate change and development to other land uses. The downloadable tool is designed to be broadly applicable for coastal and noncoastal areas alike. Tool functions simulate erosion, pollution, and the accumulation from overland flow. (Requires MapWindow GIS v.4.8.8 (open source software))
