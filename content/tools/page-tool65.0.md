Developed By: USGS

**Summary:** The USGS Coastal Change Hazards Portal is an easy to use tool that synthesizes geospatial information about extreme storms, shorelines change, and sea level rise and makes it available for viewing and download. 

Information and products are organized within three coastal change hazard themes: 1) extreme storms, 2) shoreline change, and 3) sea-level rise. Each data item represents an individual research product, with some items grouped together as aggregates to show the breadth of the topic and make it easy to explore. Data are easily exportable, but some data layers are limited to east coast applications. Available data layers include coastal change forecasts, beach morphology, hurricane and nor'easter overwash scenarios, long-term and short-term rates of shoreline change, coastal response scenarios, and coastal vulnerability.
