**Summary:** The Diagnostic Spreadsheet for Analysis of Water Quality Data analyzes Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Chlorophyll data to determine if minimum light requirements for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) growth are met at a given station.
 
This tool is an automated Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that enables users to input data for chlorophyll and TSS manually or through a guided, automatic mode to calculate concentrations and their impact on the growth of SAV. The tool includes instructions for data entry and outputs summary and action, which includes system status and management options for 4 different scenarios. Management options are only available if they are mathematically feasible and include options that calculate target levels of chlorophyll, TSS, or both. Two of the options are calculated only if target requirements can be met by reducing the concentration of either of the two inputs.  Another component of the tool graphs Normalized Habitat Requirements based on the inputs for TSS and chlorophyll to visualize what concentrations are necessary for different levels of SAV growth. This tool is intended for more advanced users that have some knowledge of the impacts of TSS and chlorophyll on water quality and growth of SAVs.
