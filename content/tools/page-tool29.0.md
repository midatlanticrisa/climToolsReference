**Summary:** The Applied Climate Information System (ACIS) Drought Portal allows users to view past and current temperature and precipitation data from weather stations throughout the US. 

This tool generates interactive graphs and tables summarizing a variety of temperature and precipitation metrics at daily, monthly, and annual time steps. In addition to temperature and preciptation data, users can also view applied climate variables such as heating, cooling, and growing degree days. To view the data, users must specify one more weather stations by name or ID, or search for stations by city, state, or zip code. Most data products feature an interactive graph and table, as well as an option to download the plots and data. The interface of this tool is simple and provides a variety of display and summary options. Using this tool, however, may require trial and error, as there are no tutorials, definitions, or links to supporting information.
