**Summary:** The CCRM Shoreline Management Self-Guided Decision Tools guide users through a series of questions about shoreline conditions to provide a shoreline best management practice recommendation. 

The decision-trees provided by this tool are similar to the dichotomous keys used by biologists and naturalists to identify plants and animals. These decision-trees guide the user through a series of questions about shoreline condition, to determine the environmentally preferable approach for shoreline management. The recommended approaches are meant to optimize shoreline functions, while still reducing risk to upland structures from intense or long-term erosion. Site-specific evaluations of shoreline condition are necessary to use this tool. However, excellent documentation is provided to assist non-experts with shoreline evaluation.
