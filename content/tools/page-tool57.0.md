**Summary:** i-Tree is a collection of tools designed to help users evaluate the benefits of local tree species, by assessing their economic value and benefits over time. 

By providing information such as location, species, tree size, condition, and location in relationship existing structures, users receive specific estimates of CO2 mitigation, air quality improvements, and stormwater interception of existing and or planned tree species. Listed in order of increasing complexity, i-Tree is made up of the following subtools: MyTree, Landscape, Design, Canopy, Eco, and Hydro. All tools are available for download on Windows/PC, with i-Tree Eco and Hydro only available as downloadable software. All other tools can be used in the web browser.
