Developed By: EPA

**Summary:** Part of the Creating Resilient Water Utilities (CRWU) initiative, the Climate Resilience Evaluation and Awareness Tool (CREAT) 3.0 is a risk assessment application for water utilities. The tool allows water utilities from across the U.S. to assess current climate conditions, create future projections for climate, and develop adaptation reports.  

A web-based, iterative process CREAT 3.0 is the latest version of the CREAT Risk Assessment Application for Water Utilities. CREAT 3.0 consists of 5 modules which use recent national assessments and the most current available scientific information at the time of development to look at extreme weather events and build scenarios to identify at-risk areas. Tool outputs are intended to assist water utilities with selecting and justifying investments in climate change adaptations. Throughout the process, users can contribute data or information to improve identification of at-risk areas.
