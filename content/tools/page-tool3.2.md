**Summary:** The Delaware Bay Operational Forecast System (DBOFS) tool is a data viewer that provides real time forecasts of oceanographic conditions in the Delaware Bay. 

The Delaware Bay Operational Forecast System (DBOFS) provides water level, water current, temperature, and salinity "nowcasts" and forecasts based on a hydrodynamic model for the Delaware Bay. The "nowcast" incorporates recent observations and data to predict oceanographic conditions over the past 24 hours, for locations where observational data are not available. Whereas the forecast guidance provides predictions of oceanographic conditions over the next 48 hours. The nowcast and forecast guidance provided by this tool are updated 4 times a day (every 6 hours). Users can view the nowcast and forecast guidance as an animation of the entire Delaware Bay or as a time series at specific locations. While the primary focus of this tool is on recent and near-time data, previous data products older than 31 days can also be retrieved through an archive request.
