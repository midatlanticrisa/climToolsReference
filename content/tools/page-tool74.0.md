**Summary:** The Delaware Air Quality Forecast is a user-friendly forecast that provides daily air quality forecasts for the state of Delaware.

This forecast's primary objective is to report the level of health concern due to air pollution. The Air Quality Forecast uses the national Air Quality Index (AQI), a classification system created by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that communicates how clean or polluted the air is. The tool's brief "Forecast Discussion" describes the implications of the air quality forecast by categorizing the related public health concerns.  Users can also view historic air quality data from reports dating back to 2012. 

The Air Quality Forecast also provides links to educational resources that users can use to learn what factors affect air quality, how air quality affects human health, and suggestions for individual approaches to increase air quality.
