Developed By: NOAA, and MARISA

**Summary:** The MARISA Climate Data Portal is a data download center that provides climate data from a variety of sources for the Chesapeake Bay region. 

Available data include an experimental precipitation dataset developed by MARISA researchers (ChexWX) as well as a variety of additional gridded temperature and precipitation data including: Daymet, Livneh, METDATA, nClimGrid, and PRISM.  Theses datasets are useful for looking at historical climate data, but do not include data for current or future climate projections. This tool is intended for advanced users with experience working with gridded data. Users with less technical experience are directed to the Interactive Map for the MARISA Region.
