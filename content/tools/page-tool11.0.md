**Summary:** The Know Your Zone tool is an interactive mapping tool that allows residents of coastal Virginia to determine their evacuation zone for hurricanes and severe storms. 

Know Your Zone was designed to help residents of coastal Virginia determine whether they should evacuate or shelter at home during an emergency. The tool is based on tiered evacuation zones and provides an interactive, color-coded map displaying each evacuation zone as well as state evacuation routes. For more detail, users can zoom to an area of interest or search by address to find a specific location. Information about hurricane season and the tiered evacuation zones for coastal Virginia can be found within the tool. The tool also contains additional information on other hurricane preparation techniques, available evacuation routes, and an assortment of ready-made outreach materials known as the “Know Your Zone Digital Toolbox”. This tool will not tell users which zone is being evacuated in the case of an emergency.
