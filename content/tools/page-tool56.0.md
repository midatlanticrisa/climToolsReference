**Summary:** NOAA Fisheries Social Indicators Toolbox is comprised of a suite of social, economic, and environmental indicators that describe and evaluate a community’s ability to respond to change. In addition, the Toolbox includes several metrics that reflect the relative level of each community’s involvement in commercial and recreational fishing, placing fisheries dependence into a human context. The indicator map and graphing tool enables users to conduct and download custom queries for over 4,600 coastal communities in 23 states.
