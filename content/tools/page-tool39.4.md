**Summary:** Part of the Climate Smart Farming toolkit, the Winter Cover Crop Planting Scheduler calculates the probability that specific cover crops reach important levels of growth by the end of the growing season.  

Designed to help agricultural producers select appropriate cover crops and optimize planting dates, the Winter Cover Crop Planting Scheduler predicts the probability of cover crop growth based on planting date for three cover crop varieties. By providing their location, this tool allows users to examine the probability of reaching specific thresholds for Rye, Buckwheat and Mustard by the end of the season, based on planting date. While background knowledge of crop growth is helpful for interpreting tool output, beginner users can utilize a series of video tutorials and explanations to become familiar with the features of the tool. The tool is still being revised and users are encouraged to provide feedback to the developers.
