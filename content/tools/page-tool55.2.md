**Summary:** The USGS National Water Census Data Portal Streamflow tool allows users to address streamflow averages for a specific locality, if a nearby stream gage is available. 

This tool helps users assess streamflow magnitude, duration, frequency, timing, and rate of change. Observed streamflow can be viewed in plots and additional data and statistics are easily exported. Calculated statistics are clearly explained and useful for assessment. This tool provides the option to view two locations simultaneously in order to view assessed statistics side by side. The tool is limited by where gages are present. Data collection varies by gage and ranges from 1950 to present. Data can also be calculated and accessed through a corresponding R package provided in the portal.
