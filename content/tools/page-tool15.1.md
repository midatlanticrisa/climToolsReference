Developed By: EPA

**Summary:** Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS) is a multipurpose environmental analysis system designed to help regional, state, and local agencies perform watershed- and water quality-based studies. 

BASINS can be installed for free and operates using an open source GIS platform. Users input GIS data that can be accessed through the tool's web download portal or uploaded from the user's own data. BASINS contains a variety of tools, such as watershed delineation and time-series management, that can be used with model plug-ins (installed separately) to create different environmental analyses. While learning the various components of the tool can be time intensive, the EPA provides thorough resources, such as a handbook and many tutorials, to train even inexperienced users to utilize BASINS full analysis capacity.  BASINS also provides decision support, allowing users to evaluate the impact of various management decisions related to watershed management, development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), coastal zone management, nonpoint source programs, water quality modeling, and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NDPES) permitting.
