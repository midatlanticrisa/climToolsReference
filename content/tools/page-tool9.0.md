Developed By: USGS

**Summary:** The Exploration and Graphics RivEr Trends (EGRET) is an R package for the analysis of hydrologic data concerning long-term changes in rivers, river flows, and river quality.

EGRET is an tool for advanced users who have experience working with the software R. After downloading EGRET, users can conduct exploratory analyses about water quality and discharge across long-term averages, variability patterns, and temporal trends. The software enables users to acquire data records, process data for analysis, and display findings through various graphical techniques such as plots and graphs. The software accepts data from several government agencies, including US Geological Survey and Environmental Protection Agency, but the dataRetrieval package is required in order to access the data from government agencies. Users can also import their own data through a comma-separated file. Basic information about how to use EGRET and dataRetrieval are available as pdf documents.
