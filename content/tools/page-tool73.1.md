Developed By: EPA

**Summary:** The EPA's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is a software application that simulates water runoff quantity and quality. The model is used for planning, analysis, and design related to stormwater runoff, combined and sanitary sewers, and other drainage systems in urban and rural areas. SWMM was developed to support local, state, and national stormwater and runoff management objectives and reduce discharges that cause impairment of waterbodies. 

Users must download the software and then input spatial data to generate stormwater simulations for large-scale planning analyses of continuous water quality/quantity data or for modeling a single-storm event. The tool accounts for various hydrological processes and allows users to incorporate climate change projections into their analyses through the SWMM Climate Adjustment Tool (SWMM-CAT).

The tool has extensive help documentation available online, including a manual, user's guide, and help portal for technical support.
