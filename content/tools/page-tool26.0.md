**Summary:** The EPA's MyEnvironment tool is an online dashboard that provides access to a cross-section environmental information specific to a user's location. 

The MyEnvironment tool displays local environmental data through a simple dashboard, specific to a user-provided location. Through this dashboard users can explore environmental data such as local air and water quality, as well as the distribution of known hazardous waste sites and local health risks. Through the dashboard, users can also find information on local greenhouse gas emissions and energy production/consumption. MyEnvironment provides a basic explanation of each item as well as links to supporting information and additional resources. This tool may be particularly useful for citizens and residents interested in better understanding their local environmental conditions. However, users should be aware that not all of the information is available for every location.
