**Summary:** The Beach Nourishment Viewer is an online database including project data from more than 2,000 beach nourishment projects across the US dating back to 1923.

This tool provides the size, cost, and location of past beach nourishment projects across the US. By specifying a coastal state and specific beach, users access an interactive map that shows where nourishment projects have taken place, the number of nourishment events or episodes per project, and the cost and inflated cost of nourishment projects in 2019 dollars. The Beach Nourishment viewer also includes a table with additional project specifications for each episode at a particular location. 

In addition to the data viewer, users have the option to download a data spreadsheet including a comprehensive record of nourishment projects in the selected location. An Explanation of Beach Nourishment Episode Attributes is available through a help link that provides a glossary feature to explain key terms and concepts referenced through this tool.
