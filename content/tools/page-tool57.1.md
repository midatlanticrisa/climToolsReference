**Summary:** The most basic tool, i-Tree MyTree, generates a simple report quantifying the benefits of existing trees in a specific location. i-Tree Landscape provides the broader context of tree benefits through an interactive map displaying tree canopy, land cover, and basic demographic information. This tool also generates a report summarizing local land use, demographics, and tree cover/benefits for a specific location. 

i-Tree MyTree and Landscape are intended to reach a wide audience of individuals who may not be subject matter experts. This includes the public, landowners, real estate agents, educators, and Community Officials. Because of their easy-to-use interface these tools reach a wider audience than more complex i-Tree tools. i-Tree landscape has the option to view RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 and multiple health risk scenarios. In creating the report users have the option to give factors low and high priority and weight factors separately.
