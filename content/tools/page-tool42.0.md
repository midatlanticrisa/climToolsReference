**Summary:** The CCAM Explorer is an interactive graphing tool that allows users to examine survey results from the Climate Change in the American Mind (CCAM) project. 

Led by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason Center for Climate Change communication, the CCAM project is national survey of public opinion on climate change. This survey tracks changes in American beliefs and attitudes about climate change through a series of survey questions about risk perceptions, policy preferences, and information acquisition behaviors. The CCAM explorer allows users view survey data from 2007-2018 through a series of interactive graphs portraying climate views over time, and by demographics and political views. Output graphs can be easily downloaded or shared online through social media or a web link. This tool provides excellent documentation, describing the project purpose and methodology as well as links to access the raw data and learn more about project.
