**Summary:** Virginia's 2015 Wildlife Action Plan contains ecological data and conservation plans for hundreds of species. The plan has reports and interactive maps that make ecological data available on a planning district commission-level. Locality-specific reports document conservation needs in communities, with prioritized actions for locally threatened species. 

This Plan describes opportunities to maintain and improve our natural habitats, allowing us to conserve wildlife in ways that benefit people. Emphasizes habitat conservation. While single species efforts may be necessary to conserve the most critically imperiled species, scores of other species can be effectively and efficiently conserved via actions that protect and restore the quality of their habitats. Communicates priority actions and needs at the local level. By providing Local Action Plan Summaries for each of 21 planning regions in Virginia, this new Action Plan will better facilitate conservation actions among a diversity of conservation partners. Prioritizes species by describing each species' level of imperilment and applying a triage approach to consider what actions can be taken to address threats to a species and its habitats.
