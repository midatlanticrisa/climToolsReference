**Summary:** The CRWU provides tools, training, and technical assistance for drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater utilities to build climate resilience. Resources provided by this tool include publications and reports, case studies, workshops, and adaptation strategies. 

The purpose of this tool is to help utilities prepare for extreme weather conditions through planning resources, risk assessments, scenarios, and adaptation resources. CRWU is intended to assist with assessing long-term adaptation options for water-sector utilities by creating easy-to-use, iterative, and interactive tools.  To improve accuracy of some of the tools, users can choose to provide basic contact information and select conditions of interest. Although this tool provides a variety of adaptation examples and case studies it does not explicitly state the costs of adaptation.
