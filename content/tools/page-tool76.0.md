**Summary:** This real-time visualization of global environmental conditions is a great illustration of atmospheric and oceanic circulation and Earth's physical systems. The tool is primarily a data visualization and teaching tool. The click-and-drag interface allows the user to explore physical and chemical parameters of the oceans and atmosphere at various spatial scales and at several atmospheric levels. The interface is intuitive, past data are archived, and short-term forecasts are also viewable. Unfortunately, data downloads are not enabled.
