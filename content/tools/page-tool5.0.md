**Summary:** The RAFT is a collaborative, year-long process designed to assist coastal localities working to improve their climate resilience. 

The RAFT first provides participating communities with a Resilience Scorecard, assessing community resilience to flooding and other coastal storm hazards. The RAFT then facilitates a community workshop where participants develop a Resilience Action Checklist to be completed and/or initiated within the next year and provides one year of implementation support/assistance. Examples of previous RAFT assessments can be found on their website, however results are site specific and may not be applicable for additional communities. To learn more about how to do a raft assessment in your community contact TheRAFT@virginia.edu
