**Summary:** The Wetbud: Wetland Water Budget Modeling Software is a software application that calculates a water budget for a created or existing wetland. 

This advanced tool requires users to provide data such as longitude and latitude, wetland area, wetland elevation, and the catchment NRCS Curve Number to produce a site-specific wetland water budget. Based on these details, Wetbud then calculates a water budget using the historical wet, dry, and normal year data from the closest weather station. Users can also create water budgets for alternative scenarios by providing alternative weather data. This tool requires substantial input data that may be difficult and time consuming to acquire if not readily available. Although this is a technical tool designed for advanced users, the developers provide several helpful resources and tutorials with sample data. This tool comes with a multi user database, so tool outputs can be easily shared across devices, which may be useful for environmental consultants or planners who want to share different scenarios. All of the data provided by Wetbud is easily exported into Excel.
