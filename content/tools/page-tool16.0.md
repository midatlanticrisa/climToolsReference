**Summary:** The Sea-Level Report cards provide interactive graphs and narrative descriptions of sea-level trends and projections for 32 coastal locations across the U.S.

This easy-to-use tool allows users to view trends and future projections of monthly mean sea level to the year 2050. The report cards also describe local processes affecting sea-level trends and allow users to compare trends across different locations. The report cards are updated annually as new water level data become available.
