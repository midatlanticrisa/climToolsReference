**Summary:** This tool from AdaptVA uses an interactive map to display sea level rise projections and FEMA flood hazard zones, as well as social vulnerability, infrastructure, and natural capital in a single viewer. 

This easy-to-use tool provides three sea level rise scenarios (low, intermediate, and extreme), which can be viewed at 10-year increments from 1992 â€“ 2100. Users may click through or automate the display to view 10-year intervals for each sea level rise scenario. Users can also overlay addition features portraying vulnerability/risk, infrastructure, recommended shoreline management, and natural resources.  This tool is intended for beginner users and does not require any specialized software or training.
