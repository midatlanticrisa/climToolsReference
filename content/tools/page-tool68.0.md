Developed By: Nature's Network

**Summary:** The Prioritization Tool from Natureâ€™s Network is an interactive mapping tool that helps identify conservation priorities, such as rare and threatened habitats for species of greatest conservation need. The tool provides local planners with a broad, regional context for areas of degraded habitat that could contribute to a network of connected, intact, and resilient sites.

The tool allows users to build customized ecological models using a catalog of nearly 400 metrics as well as display pre-designed prioritization maps for already defined scenarios. 
The user selects the geography in which they want to build the model and then selects pertinent metrics from four categories: Ecological, Species, Land Use, and Conservation. The user can also specify a relative importance for each metric and assign it a positive or negative value.  

Users can view an interactive map for pre-defined scenarios, found on the main tool page. Users can also save their custom models and will receive a code that allows them to return to their customized results in the future. A pdf of the map and .csv file of the data and model can be downloaded from the tool as well.
