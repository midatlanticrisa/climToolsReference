Users may also select U.S. climate divisions to view recent historical trends in temperature and precipitation. Additional weather information provided by this tool include weather radar and a drought monitor. Although this mapping tool is centered on the Mid-Atlantic region, users may zoom out to view the entire contiguous United States.
