**Summary:** The Shoreline Assessment Mapper is an interactive map that displays a variety of shoreline data for the coastal zone of Virginia. 

This easy-to-use tool allows users to view a variety of data layers describing shoreline type and condition. Some of the available data layers include aquaculture sites, wetlands, shoreline structures, and oyster reefs. While most of the data layers describe current conditions, some historical data such as the historical tidal marsh inventory is also available. This tool does not provide future projections of shoreline extent or condition.
