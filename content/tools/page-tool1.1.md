**Summary:** The AdaptVA Sea Level Rise Projection Viewer uses an interactive map to display sea level rise projections for coastal Virginia. 

This easy-to-use tool provides three sea level rise scenarios (low, intermediate, and extreme), which can be viewed at 10-year increments from 1992 â€“ 2100. Users may click through or automate the display to view 10-year intervals for each sea level rise scenario. This tool is intended for beginner users and does not require any specialized software or training.
