#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Diagnostic Spreadsheet for Analysis of Water Quality Data analyzes Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Chlorophyll data to determine if minimum light requirements for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) growth are met at a given station.
 
This tool is an automated Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that enables user to input data for Chlorophyll and TSS either manually or through a guided, automatic mode to calculate concentrations and their impact on the growth of SAVs. The tool includes instructions for data entry and outputs summary and action, which includes system status and management options for 4 different scenarios. Management options are only available if they are mathematically feasible and include options that calculate target levels of chlorophyll or TSS , or both. Two of the options are calculated only if target requirements can be met by reducing the concentration of either of the two inputs.  Another component of the tool graphs Normalized Habitat Requirements based on the inputs for TSS and Chlorophyll to visualize what concentrations are necessary to permit different amounts of growth of the SAVs. This tool is intended for more advanced users that have some knowledge of the impacts of TSS and Chlorophyll on water quality and growth of SAVs.

**Relevance:** SAV health is critical to the health of the bay; interaction between climate change and increased turbidity, with the darker/more turbid water potentially absorbing more heat. Increased water temperature and turbidity leads to the dying off of SAV

**Scope:** Generalized

**Target Audience:** Researchers, estoration Specialists, tate Agencies, Conservationists, Decisionmakers, Environmental Agencies, Environmental Consultant, Environmental Planner, Educators, Extension and Outreach Professionals

**Strengths:** Site-specific results, Allows user to input own data, Introduction/instruction guide, Provides multiple management scenarios

**Limitations:** Does not provide future projections, Requires externally collected data
