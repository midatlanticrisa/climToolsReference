#### Tool Summary
**Description:** Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS) is a multipurpose environmental analysis system designed to help regional, state, and local agencies perform watershed- and water quality-based studies. 

BASINS can be installed for free and operates using an open source GIS platform. Users input GIS data that can be accessed through the tool's web download portal or uploaded from the user's own data. BASINS contains a variety of tools, such as watershed delineation and time-series management, that can be used with model plug-ins (installed separately) to create different environmental analyses. While learning the various components of the tool can be time intensive, the EPA provides thorough resources, such as a handbook and many tutorials, to train even inexperienced users to utilize BASINS full analysis capacity.  BASINS also provides decision support, allowing users to evaluate the impact of various management decisions related to watershed management, development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), coastal zone management, nonpoint source programs, water quality modeling, and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NDPES) permitting.


**Relevance:** Can be used to assess effect of multiple management scenarios on current climate conditions

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Conservationists, Decision-makers, Environmental Agencies, Natural Resource Professionals, Planners, Public, Researchers

**Strengths:** allows user to create specific scenarios, Provides different management scenarios based on user decisions, multiple data sets available, process can be applied at various locations, Can run analysis for large and small scale study areas

**Limitations:** Can be time- and resource-intensive process if data not readily available, Management scenarios rely on historical climate data
