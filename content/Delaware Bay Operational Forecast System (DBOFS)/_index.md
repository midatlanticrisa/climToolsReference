#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Delaware Bay Operational Forecast System (DBOFS) tool is a data viewer that provides real time forecasts of oceanographic conditions in the Delaware Bay. 

The Delaware Bay Operational Forecast System (DBOFS) provides water level, water current, temperature, and salinity "nowcasts" and forecasts based on a hydrodynamic model for the Delaware Bay. The "nowcast" incorporates recent observations and data to predict oceanographic conditions over the past 24 hours, for locations where observational data are not available. Whereas the forecast guidance provides predictions of oceanographic conditions over the next 48 hours. The nowcast and forecast guidance provided by this tool are updated 4 times a day (every 6 hours). Users can view the nowcast and forecast guidance as an animation of the entire Delaware Bay or as a time series at specific locations. While the primary focus of this tool is on recent and near-time data, previous data products older than 31 days can also be retrieved through an archive request.

**Relevance:** Climate change will impact the oceanographic features addressed in this tool 
Can capture effects of increased storm events and other extreme weather conditions

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** State Agencies, Mariners, Environmental Planner, Floodplain Managers, Environmental Agencies, Researchers, Federal Agencies

**Strengths:** Updated frequently, Additional data available upon request, Captures real time data, Able to download real-time data

**Limitations:** Challenging to navigate map interface, Data older than 1 month not readily available, Model-generated nowcast and forecast
