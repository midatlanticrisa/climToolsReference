#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Virginia Coastal Geospatial and Educational Mapping System (Coastal GEMS) is an interactive map and inventory of coastal resource data and conservation planning tools for Virginiaâ€™s coastal zone. 

This easy-to-use tool integrates data from multiple natural resource agencies and other partners within a single mapping interface. Users can view and explore a variety of data layers ranging from coastal waters and wildlife, to population growth, shelfish management, and conservation planning. Within each layer, users can also find a comprehensive factsheet, providing relevant background information, links to the raw data or tool, and a description of the importance and management of the corresponding resource. Although this tool is focused on conservation planning, it also include layers relevant to climate change such as sea level rise projections, which can be overlaid to view the potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal resources. This interactive provides basic markup and searching functins, and map products can be easily exported to pdf or jpeg. Although there are no tutorials or case studies, this tool is easy to use and appropriate for users of all skill levels. Users should be aware that Coastal GEMS is ongoing, with additional layers being added and existing layers recieving varying degrees of maintenance.

**Relevance:** The tool explicitly captures the extent of multiple sea level rise scenarios. Other featuers in the tool are also important to account for when assessing climate impacts such as the locations or information surrounding submerged aquatic vegetation or healthy streams.

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** Conservationists, Decisionmakers, Environmental Agencies, Environmental Consultant, Environmental Planner, Non-governmental Organizations, Homeowners/buyers, Real Estate Agents, Restoration Specialists, State Agencies, Public, Researchers, Educators

**Strengths:** Provides supporting metadata, descriptions, and resources for each data layer, Mapping tool provides basic markup and searching features, Synthesis of variety of coastal resource tools and data

**Limitations:** No tutorials/case studies, Some data layers may be slow to load, Some features incomplete due to ongoing development
