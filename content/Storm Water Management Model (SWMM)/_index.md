#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The EPA's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is a software application for planning, analysis, and design of drainage systems in urban areas. --> this is more of an example of applications of the tool, rather than a description of what the tool does. based on what i've read, i believe this tool simulates rainfall-runoff from primarily urban areas, but that the results have been applied for many of the applications described above. 

The advanced program allows users to evaluate the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff in order to guide the development of grey infrastructure and decrease stormwater runoff. Users must download the software and then input data so as to generate stormwater simulations for large-scale planning analyses of continuous data or for modeling a single-storm event. --> what type of data?

The tool accounts for various hydrological processes, such as snow melt, and allows users to incorporate climate change projections into their analyses through the SWMM Climate Adjustment Tool (SWMM-CAT). --> does the users need to provide additional info for the climate projection? or is provided by the tool? can they run and compare multiple future scenarios?

The tool can also be used to model green infrastructure such as rain gardens, rooftop disconnection, and continuous permeable pavement systems. 

--> is this tool for beginner or advanced users? is there a tutorial? how easy/hard is it to use?

**Relevance:** With increased storm events, grey infrastructure systems will become very important but will also be placed under additional pressure. Using this tool, users can prepare for these additional stormwater burdens by planning for effective water systems.

**Scope:** Generalized

**Target Audience:** Environmental Agencies, Environmental Consultant, Environmental Planner, Federal Agencies, Floodplain Managers, Planners, Researchers, State Agencies, Engineers

**Strengths:** Tutorial and beginner manual povided, Accounts for various hydrological processes (ex: snow melt), Although targetted at urban areas, can be applied for non-urban areas as well

**Limitations:** Requires technical expertise in hydrolgoy, Requires software download
