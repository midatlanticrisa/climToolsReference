#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The EPA's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is a software application that simulates water runoff quantity and quality. The model is used for planning, analysis, and design related to stormwater runoff, combined and sanitary sewers, and other drainage systems in urban and rural areas. SWMM was developed to support local, state, and national stormwater and runoff management objectives and reduce discharges that cause impairment of waterbodies. 

Users must download the software and then input spatial data to generate stormwater simulations for large-scale planning analyses of continuous water quality/quantity data or for modeling a single-storm event. The tool accounts for various hydrological processes and allows users to incorporate climate change projections into their analyses through the SWMM Climate Adjustment Tool (SWMM-CAT).The tool has extensive help documentation available online, including a manual, user's guide, and help portal for technical support.


**Relevance:** With increased storm and heavy precipitation events, stormwater infrastructure systems will be placed under additional pressure and will need to upgrade their capacity accordingly. Using this tool, users can prepare for these additional stormwater burdens by designing effective water systems with anticipated precipitation changes taken into account.

**Scope:** Generalized

**Target Audience:** Environmental Agencies
*Environmental Consultant
*Environmental Planner
