#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The i-Tree Canopy tool creates a custom canopy cover report and assess the benefits (or costs) of increasing or decreasing the canopy cover in a user-defined location. Using google earth imagery, users then must classify the cover type (i.e., tree, non-tree, water, etc.) at randomly distributed points within the study area. This information can be time consuming to collect; however, it can be used as in conjunction with i-Tree Eco, as the canopy cover input data.

**Relevance:** Trees sequester carbon, provide shade, and aid in storm water retention. Planting trees increases resiliency and helps mitigate climate change.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Non-governmental Organizations
* Planners 
* Public 
* Homeowners/buyers 
* Real Estate Agents 
* Educators
* Urban planners
* Environmental Planners
* Decisionmakers
* Extension and Outreach Professionals
* Foresters
* conservationist
* Community Officials
* Urban Foresters

**Strengths:** Option to upload shapefiles
* Provides location specific scenarios
* Series of explainer videos

**Limitations:** Requires knowledge of cover class
* Accuracy depends on the users ability to correctly identify cover class
