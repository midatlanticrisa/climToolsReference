#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The AdaptVA Sea Level Rise Projection Viewer uses an interactive map to display sea level rise projections for coastal Virginia. 

This easy-to-use tool provides three sea level rise scenarios (low, intermediate, and extreme), which can be viewed at 10-year increments from 1992 â€“ 2100. Users may click through or automate the display to view 10-year intervals for each sea level rise scenario. This tool is intended for beginner users and does not require any specialized software or training.

**Relevance:** Explicit: SLR

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** Community Officials

* Can easily search for locality of interest

**Limitations:** Cannot compare maps simultaneously/side-by-side 
* No overlays with additional features, such as housing or critical infrastructure
* No documentation or explanation of sea level rise scenarios
