#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Climate Impact Map is an interactive mapping tool that displays historical and projected changes in future temperature in the United States and across the globe. 

With both a US and global map view, this tool allows users to visualize the potential impact of various emissions scenarios on national and global temperatures by the end of the century. Using the interactive map, users can display a variety of temperature metrics including annual and seasonal averages, as well as days below freezing and above 95 degrees F. For each metric, users can view historical data (1986-2005) or future projections at three time-steps (next 20 years, mid-century, and end of century). Future projections are available for high (RCP 8.5), low (RCP 4.5), and moderate (RCP 2.5) emissions scenarios. By default, this tool will display the median probability projections, however users can also view low and high probability projections. The option to select probability is a unique feature that allows users to better understand the likelihood of future climate conditions. This tool provides clear documentation of methodology, as well as an option to download data in an excel file. This tool covers a wide geographic range and therefore the downloaded data is generalized by state, rather than by county as illustrated in the map viewer.

**Relevance:** Due to climate change, temperatures are expected to keep increasing throughout the century.  Understanding projected temperature change enabled more effective planning and resilience efforts that mitigate the effects of extreme heat.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Citizens
* Community members
* Planners
* Environmental Planner
* Public
* Community Officials

**Strengths:** Interactive tool 
* Option to export data
* Addresses uncertainty 
* Detailed methodology

**Limitations:** No ability to input additional data
* Downloadable data is by state, not locality
