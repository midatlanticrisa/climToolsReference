**Description:** The Maryland Coastal Atlas is a mapping tool that allows users query, map, and analyze spatial data to better understand Maryland's coastal and marine resources. 

This mapping tool was designed to help state and local Decisionmakers analyze and explore coastal and ocean data layers for project and planning applications. The interactive map includes a variety of data layers, ranging from recreational uses of marine resources to shoreline rates of change. However, users also have the option to add additional data through ArcGIS online, URL links, or by uploading GIS data. This tool includes a coastal resiliency assessment layer, developed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and The Nature conservancy to identity priority restoration and conservation areas for enhancing coastal resiliency. Although no advanced training is required to use this tool, it also provides a variety of helpful case studies and tutorials.

**Relevance:** Through this tool, users can identify areas vulnerable to sea level rise, flooding, and erosion which can be used to inform planning and management decisions. This tool also provides a resiliency layer to target areas for restoration that would improve coastal resilience.

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** Researchers, Federal Agencies, Floodplain Managers, Nongovernmental Organizations, State Agencies, Natural Resource Professionals, Planners, Environmental Agencies

**Strengths:** Allows user to create specific scenarios, Users can upload additional data, Includes a step-by-step tutorial, Can export final maps and charts
