#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The MARISA Climate Impacts Summary and Outlook Reports are a quarterly series summarizing seasonal weather and climate trends and forecasts for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

Released seasonally, these reports summarize recent weather events in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed and provide a forecast for the upcoming season. Each report describes recent significant weather events, seasonal temperature and precipitation, a seasonal weather forecast, and an analysis of long-term trends and climate projection. Figures and charts illustrating the data are clearly explained, as well as potential implications of weather forecasts and trends. Users can sign up to be notified by email when new editions are published online.

**Relevance:** Summaries show how climate and extreme weather events are changing annually and compared to historical records. They help interpret the effects to climate change and what the impacts of these changes may look like.

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** Policy makers
* Practitioners
* Residents
* Community Officials

**Strengths:** Report issued quarterly
