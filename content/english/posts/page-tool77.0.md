Developer: NOAA Office for Coastal Management

#### Tool Summary
**Description:** This open-source version of the Nonpoint Source Pollution and Erosion Comparison Tool is used to investigate potential water quality impacts from climate change and development to other land uses. The downloadable tool is designed to be broadly applicable for coastal and noncoastal areas alike. Tool functions simulate erosion, pollution, and the accumulation from overland flow. (Requires MapWindow GIS v.4.8.8 (open source software))

**Relevance:** OpenNSPECT uses spatial elevation data to calculate flow direction and flow accumulation throughout a watershed. Can be used to map surface water runoff volumes, pollutants, and total sediment loads, identify areas that might benefit from changes to proposed development strategies, and analyze land use change scenarios and impacts.

**Scope:** Generalized

**Target Audience:** Extension and Outreach Professionals
* Natural Resource Professionals
* Academics
* Government

**Strengths:** Provides training and input data 
*Can be used in any area with available data

**Limitations:** Requires several data inputs 
*Requires download 
*Technical skills are required
*Requires MapWindow GIS v.4.8.8 (open source software)
