Developer: Headwater Economics

#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Headwaters Economics Neighborhoods at Risk tool uses an interactive map to display characteristics of potentially vulnerable neighborhoods in 27 U.S. cities. 

This easy-to-use tool is designed to help conduct vulnerability assessments and prioritize capital improvements. Using the interactive map, or simple slider bars, users can determine what percent of the population within each census tract, meets selected indicators of hardship, race, or age. This tool also indicates what percent of each census tract are in the 500-yr floodplain as well as percent impervious surface and area lacking tree canopy. In addition to census tract data, this tool also includes a sidebar displaying climate change projections for two emissions scenarios. This tool provides a great summary of vulnerability and some climate data; however, at this time it is only available for a few cities.

**Relevance:** Climate change leads to more extreme weather which increases flooding, especially in areas with high  social vulnerability.

**Scope:** Locality

**Target Audience:** Government Officials
* Decisionmakers
* Environmental Planners
* Planners
* Citizens

**Strengths:** Easy-to-use interactive interface
* Detailed explanation of models and supporting information
* Includes a wide range of urban areas
* Working to expand its range

**Limitations:** Only available for selected cities, no rural locations
* Limited flood information
* Climate projections not linked to vulnerability data
