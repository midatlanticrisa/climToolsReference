#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The RAFT is a collaborative, year-long process designed to assist coastal localities working to improve their climate resilience. 

The RAFT first provides participating communities with a Resilience Scorecard, assessing community resilience to flooding and other coastal storm hazards. The RAFT then facilitates a community workshop where participants develop a Resilience Action Checklist to be completed and/or initiated within the next year and provides one year of implementation support/assistance. Examples of previous RAFT assessments can be found on their website, however results are site specific and may not be applicable for additional communities. To learn more about how to do a raft assessment in your community contact TheRAFT@virginia.edu

**Relevance:** This study allows users to view resilience measures undertaken by other communities which can help communities prepare for climate change impacts such as sea level rise.

**Scope:** Locality

**Target Audience:** Community Officials, Decisionmakers, Floodplain Managers, Non-governmental Organizations, Planners, Public, State Agencies

**Strengths:** Easy to navigate website, Provides site specific assessments, Free for participating communities, Includes case studies of previous assessments

**Limitations:** Requires community participation, Results are locality-specific/ may not be applicable in every community
