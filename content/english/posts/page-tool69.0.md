#### Tool Summary
**Description:** Based on analyses by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the Flood Economics Tool provides information, data, and case studies describing the benefits of flood mitigation investments at the state and community level. 

Through this tool users can find general information describing the benefits and approaches to flood mitigation investment, as well as brief case studies describing communities and homeowners benefitting from flood mitigation action. Flood Economics also provides an analysis of statewide flood mitigation across the US, including key statistics such as the total investment, average return on investment, and the estimated benefits of flood mitigations actions by state, from 1996-2016.  Each statewide summary includes simple graphics and data visualizations of investment statistics, along with a basic filtering function to view investments over time. With easy-to-understand case studies and definitions of investment terms, this tool is appropriate for users of all skill levels.

**Relevance:** Warmer temperatures from climate change increase the likelihood of flooding events which then necessitate greater mitigation efforts.

**Scope:** National
