#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Virginia Flood Risk Information System uses an interactive map to display FEMA flood risk zones in Virginia. 

This easy-to-use, interactive mapping tool allows users to quickly locate a property to determine if it is within a Special Flood Hazards Area (SFHA) or non-regulatory flood zone. In addition to the mapping tool, users can also search for and download FEMA reports and data including FIRM Panels, Flood Insurance Studies (FIS) and Flood Risk Reports (FRR). This tool includes an excellent “Help/Information” window, which provides instructions, data information, and links to additional resources.

**Relevance:** Increased precipitation and more extreme storms are all caused by climate change. While FEMA flood maps do not consider potential future impacts, this tool helps individuals assess current flood risk in order to mitigate the effect of flooding on their home.

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** Real Estate Agents
* Property Buyers/Owners
* Community Officials
* Planners

**Strengths:** Easy-to-use, interactive map viewer with various flood zone layers
* Excellent welcome guide/tutorial
* Option to download data and reports
* Option to upload additional data, if available

**Limitations:** No projections of future flood risk
* Additional map layers must be supplied by user
