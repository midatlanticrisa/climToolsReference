#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Percent Light at Leaf (PLL) calculator can be used to estimate the percentage of light penetrating the water column and reaching submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) leaf surface at a given depth.   

The PLL calculator is an automated Microsoft Excel 97 spreadsheet that calculates PLL from four user-provided water quality variables: dissolved inorganic nitrogen (mg/l), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (mg/l), total suspended solids (mg/l), and either diffuse downwelling PAR attenuation coefficient (Kd) or Secchi depth (m). The user must also provide the depth of sediment-water interface (i.e., restoration depth) as well as the tidal range (optional). This tool is intended for more advanced users with at least some knowledge of SAV growth and light requirements. 



**Relevance:** Submerged aquatic vegetation is important habitat for many marine creatures and water quality is an indicator of health of vegetation and subsequently the surrounding ecosystem

**Scope:** Generalized

**Target Audience:** Researchers
*Restoration Specialists
*State Agencies
*Natural Resource Professionals
*Conservationists
*Decisionmakers
*Environmental Agencies
*Environmental Consultant
*Environmental Planner

**Strengths:** Provides supporting educational information
*Uses site-specific data
*Generates site-specific results

**Limitations:** Requires background knowledge of submerged aquatic vegetation
* User must provide input data
