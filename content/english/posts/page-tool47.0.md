#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Chesapeake Assessment Scenario Tool (CAST) is a web-based nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment load modeling tool designed to streamline environmental planning. 

CAST allows Decisionmakers and planners to determine the most cost-effective strategy to meet nitrogen, phosphorous, and/or sediment load reductions within a watershed. To use this planning tool, users must specify their geographic region, then select which Best Management Practices (BMPs) they would like to simulate. Based on this information, CAST builds a management scenario and provides estimates of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment load reductions, as well as the cost of implementation. Users may run multiple scenarios to compare the load reduction benefits and costs of different management options. 

CAST's Results include interactive graphs and maps as well as customizable reports. The graphs allow for up to 4 customizable time scenarios within multiple geographical areas, and can be printed. The map comparison feature allows the user to analyze the same two spatial areas under different time periods. Report requests take some time to process but are highly tailored to the user's needs and are emailed to the user. Report topics include BMP Summaries, Base Conditions, Loads, Wastewater, and Atmospheric Deposition for specified geographic areas.


**Relevance:** CAST enables planners to analyze the cost associated with reducing nitrogen, phosphorous, and sediment loads to the bay.
