#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The i-Tree Design tool is a comprehensive tool that allows users to estimate the benefits of individual and groups of trees. By entering the location of tree species in an interactive map, users can view the current and future benefits provided by that tree. This tree placement data is compiled into a report which also provides the current and future (20 years) economic benefits of those trees.

**Relevance:** Trees sequester carbon, provide shade, and aid in stormwater retention. Planting trees increases resiliency and helps mitigate climate change.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Non-governmental Organizations
* Planners 
* Public 
* Homeowners/buyers 
* Real Estate Agents 
* Educators
* Urban planners
* Environmental Planners
* Decisionmakers
* Extension and Outreach Professionals
* Foresters
* conservationist
* Community Officials
* Urban Foresters

**Strengths:** Provides location-specific results
* Allows user to create specific scenarios 
* Welcome guide/tutorials 
* i-Tree YouTube channel dedicated to explaining how to use various tools

**Limitations:** Accuracy is dependent on users ability to select structure
* Requires knowledge of local tree species
