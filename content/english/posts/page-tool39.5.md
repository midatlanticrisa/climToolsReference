#### Tool Summary
**Description:** Part of the Climate Smart Farming toolkit, the Apple Stage/Freeze Probability Tool predicts the potential freeze damage for 3 varieties of apple crops. 

This tool â€œgraphs minimum temperature versus damage probability for the estimated phenological stage at the selected location to produce a graph of past conditions, as well as a 6-day forecast." By providing their location, apple variety, and date of interest, users can view the minimum temperature for their location in comparison to damage temperatures leading to freeze risk. The tool automatically generates a time series plot of temperature (degrees Fahrenheit) over time which can be viewed through a current season or through a 30-day outlook. Having background knowledge of crop growth is useful for using this tool, but beginner users can utilize a series of video tutorials and explanations to become familiar with the features of the tool. The tool is still being revised and users are encouraged to provide feedback to the developers.

**Relevance:** Climate change is impacting frosts and freezes which is increasing the risk of freeze damage to crop during traditional growing seasons. Through this tool, users can view freeze risks for apple varieties based on variable damage temperatures.

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** Agriculturalists, Environmental Agencies, Environmental Planner, Educators, Non-governmental Organizations, Planners, Public, State Agencies

**Strengths:** Easy-to-use interface
*Crop-specific results
*Can easily search for locality of interest

**Limitations:** Background knowledge of crop growth useful
*Tool still undergoing development
*Baseline data parameters (ex: apple phenology) developed from NY state conditions so may not be applicable to all areas
