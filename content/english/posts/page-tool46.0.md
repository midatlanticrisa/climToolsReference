#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Air Quality Forecast is a 3-part forecast, chart, and mapping tool that provides daily air quality forecasts for the Washington metropolitan area.

This forecast's primary objective is to report the level of health concern due to air pollution. The Air Quality Forecast uses the national Air Quality Index (AQI), a classification system created by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that communicates how clean or polluted the air is. The tool's "Level of Health Concerns" chart describes the implications of the air quality forecast by categorizing the related public health concerns. The provided charts and maps allow users to quickly and easily view current forecasts and recent observations of local air quality. Users can also view historic air quality data in calendar and table format dating to 1993, and are able to search for forecasts for specific locations.

The Air Quality Forecast also provides links to educational resources that users can use to learn what factors affect air quality, how air quality affects human health, and policy approaches that Decisionmakers can use to improve air quality and human health.
