#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Coastal Inundation Predictions is a report on Sea Level Rise on coastal Maryland. The report provides an assessment of the impact of sea level rise on repeat flooding and storm surge.

This tool provides in depth sea level rise projections on the Maryland coast. Broken into sections, this report explains why SLR is impacting Maryland coast more than other locations, the projections, and practical applications for the projections. In the report, projections are made in three different scenarios, Paris agreement emissions, stabilized emissions, and growing emissions. In each scenario sea level rise is projected in easy to read charts accompanied by text explaining how the projections were calculated and what they mean.

**Relevance:** Explicit: SLR

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** Government Officials
* Decisionmakers
* Community Officials
* Environmental Planner
* Planners

**Strengths:** Provides state specific examples of the effect of SLR
* Explains how projections are calculated and how the differences from past projections
* Readable to a non-science audience
* Explains what is causing Sea Level Rise

**Limitations:** Data limited to Maryland Coastal Areas
* No management/resilience suggestions
* Frequency of report publication is unclear
