#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Adaptation Workbook guides users through the process of creating an adaptation plan to prepare for land management and conservation efforts under changing conditions. 

This tool provides a structured, stepwise approachto evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on land management and conservation and design a local adaptation plan to mitigate future impacts. Using a general framework that can be tailored to individual needs, this tool accommodates a wide variety of geographic locations, land ownership types, ecosystems and land uses, management goals, and project sizes. User applications may range from forestry management to residential planning.

This tool examines soils, hydrology, temperature, and surrounding land use for the designated project site. Though the tool guides users through the assessment and planning process, users are required to provide substantial input regarding present conditions, as well as potential vulnerabilities and changes that will affect the project going forward. These vulnerabilities include ones driven by climate change as well as land use changes. This tool can be used by one person or as a collaborative project between groups. 

The tool allows users to create a custom adaptation plan, but the overall success of the project depends on the accuracy of the userâ€™s data and their ability to design, implement, and monitor the project. This tool is moderately time-intensive, however there are multiple resources and how-to guides, including a YouTube channel and a 7-week online training course, to explain how to use and get the most out of this tool. 


**Relevance:** Addresses vulnerability and risk in climate design land management and conservation actions that can help prepare for changing conditions.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Foresters
