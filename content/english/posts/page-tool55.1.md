#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The USGS National Water Census Data Portal Water Budget tool allows users to download water budget data for a selected watershed, based on the nearest water gage. 

This tool allows users to navigate to or search for a location of interest, then select a corresponding 8 or 12-digit HUC watershed layer. After selecting a watershed, the tool then  provides annual, monthly, and daily plots of mean precipitation and evapotranspiration from 1980 to present. Users can also download the precipitation and evapotranspiration data for the selected watershed, as well as any corresponding upstream watersheds. Users also have the option to compare the provided water budget data with another watershed, or to plot and download water use data for individual counties.

**Relevance:** Increased storms and precipitation extremes as well as changes to water utilization and demand will alter future water budgets.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Agriculturalists 
*Decisionmakers 
*Planners
*Industry
*Public 
*Residents/Property Owners 
*Environmental Consultant 
*Environmental Planner

**Strengths:** Wide range of statistics that can be calculated and compared across watersheds
* Multiple options to export data

**Limitations:** Options to export shape; however they do not download and are not available for all localities
* Does not provide future projections
