## MARISA
The [Mid-Atlantic Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (MARISA)](http://www.midatlanticrisa.org) program was MARISA was [established in September 2016](http://news.psu.edu/story/436700/2016/11/09/research/mid-atlantic-regional-integrated-sciences-and-assessments) through a five-year cooperative agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). MARISA supports integrated, flexible processes for building adaptive capacity to climate variability and change in diverse settings in the Mid- Atlantic region, with an initial focus on the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. MARISA was renewed for a second five-year term with an expanded team in September 2021.

MARISA is led by the non-profit [RAND Corporation](http://rand.org), in partnership with researchers in [Penn State University's Earth and Environmental Systems Institute](http://www.eesi.psu.edu), the [Environment, Energy, Sustainability and Health Institute at Johns Hopkins University](http://e2shi.jhu.edu/), the [Center for Coastal Resources Management at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences](https://www.vims.edu/ccrm/index.php), Morgan State University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the [Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University](http://www.eas.cornell.edu/). A separate NOAA award for a Chesapeake Bay Coastal Climate Extension pilot program support for personnel at Penn State, VIMS, and RAND.


## Objectives and Activities

MARISA will rely on scientific models and information alongside close interactions with stakeholders and decisionmakers to achieve its objectives.

#### Collaborating and integrating research and outreach
*Integrating researchers and communities through a problem-driven, interactive and transparent approach.* MARISA will work closely with community leaders, policymakers, practitioners, and academics, to create useful information and decision-support tools that strengthen the resilience of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed and other parts of the region to climate variability and change.

#### Assessing risks and vulnerabilities
*Closing knowledge gaps about climate-related risks and responses across the Mid-Atlantic region.* MARISA will develop climate data and tools to understand vulnerabilities in diverse contexts, including a comprehensive flood risk assessment for Chesapeake Bay communities.

#### Improving adaptation and planning strategies
*Developing planning tools to identify and evaluate adaptive integrated water resources management options.* The tools will help to ensure sustainable freshwater availability, ecosystem vitality, and economic prosperity in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed and elsewhere in the region.

#### Educating students and communities
*Training graduate and undergraduate students and community members to understand real-world challenges and opportunities in the Mid-Atlantic region.* The trainings will equip stakeholders with the skills necessary to assess and address climate risks in the region.

#### Supporting regional climate assessments
*Informing and organizing ongoing national and regional climate assessments through coordination with other regional climate programs.*

#### Evaluating progress
*Evaluating MARISAâ€™s progress and the combined impact of multiple, adjacent regional climate programs.* Periodic program-based evaluation will improve planning and operations.
