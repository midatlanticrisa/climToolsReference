#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The CCRM Shoreline Management Self-Guided Decision Tools guide users through a series of questions about shoreline conditions to provide a shoreline best management practice recommendation. 

The decision-trees provided by this tool are similar to the dichotomous keys used by biologists and naturalists to identify plants and animals. These decision-trees guide the user through a series of questions about shoreline condition, to determine the environmentally preferable approach for shoreline management. The recommended approaches are meant to optimize shoreline functions, while still reducing risk to upland structures from intense or long-term erosion. Site-specific evaluations of shoreline condition are necessary to use this tool. However, excellent documentation is provided to assist non-experts with shoreline evaluation.

**Relevance:** Responsible shoreline management can help mitigate the impacts of sea level rise and storm surge, by protecting property from flooding and storm surge which will likely become more extreme and frequent due to climate change

**Scope:** Generalized

**Target Audience:** Property Owners, State Agencies, Planners, Elected officials

**Strengths:** Can be applied to most shorelines, Provides site-specific recommendations, Provides instructions and definitions for non-experts, Can be printed for in-field use

**Limitations:** Requires site-specific information, Site visits likely necessary, Moderate effort
