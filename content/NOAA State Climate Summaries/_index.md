#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The State Climate Summaries consist of brief statewide reports, describing historical climate conditions and future climate scenarios.

Each climate summary includes key messages, as well as a narrative description and a variety of maps and figures describing climate trends and projections. The state summaries include brief descriptions of historical climate data, such as temperature change through time, precipitation change through time, and sea level change through time. Each summary also includes climate projections for two different scenarios based on estimations for a high emission scenario as well as a lower emission scenario. Each summary discusses potential impact of these scenarios on climate related problems that already affect the state, such as drought or sea level rise. The tool provides a variety of download options including brochures and figures as well as more resources at the bottom of each state summary.
