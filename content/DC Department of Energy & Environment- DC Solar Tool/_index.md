#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The D.C. Solar Tool is an interactive mapping tool that allows users to estimate the cost, average revenue, federal tax credit, carbon offset, and energy output of a solar panel system installed to their business or residence. 

This tool features a map of the D.C. area with colored building roofs that indicate the capacity of the surface to generate energy with a solar panel system in place. Users can either "click" an entire building to see the energy estimated to be generated by a system of that size, or they can use the "Draw" feature to section off a smaller area within the roof. D.C. Solar Tool accounts for shading from surrounding trees and buildings, ensuring the best assessment for panel placement. 

The estimated energy output, cost, and carbon offset values are generated in part from market values and research and are refined by citizen contributions. Solar panel users can upload their system information to the database to refine the rates calculated by the program, and to also log the systems in the area to help city planners meet the goal of the D.C. solar energy mandate of 2.5% by 2023.
