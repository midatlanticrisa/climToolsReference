#### Tool Summary
**Description:** FieldWatch is a community mapping tool that allows beekeepers, crop growers, and pesticide applicators to interact through four connected tools: BeeCheck, Fieldcheck, Cropcheck, and Drift Watch.  

This tool creates a platform for beekeepers, commercial specialty crop producers, row crop producers, and pesticide applicators to communicate regarding where bees and crops are located in relationship to where pesticides are applied in order to communicate and avoid cross contamination and pesticide drift into areas of beehives and sensitive crops. It is also a way for farmers to communicate with beekeepers about what crops are pollinator serviced and benefit from having bee hives near by. Brought to Virginia by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Science, this program requires users to create a free account in order to upload crop, beehive, and pesticide location. All information provided to FieldWatch is voluntary and therefore is not an exhaustive list; however, all entries must be approved by the states data steward so information provided is accurate. This tool is new to Virginia, but many individuals are already utilizing FiedWatch.
