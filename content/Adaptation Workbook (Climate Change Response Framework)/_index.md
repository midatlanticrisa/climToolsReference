#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Adaptation Workbook guides users through the process of creating a step by step adaptation plan to prepare for land management and conservation efforts under changing conditions. The purpose of this tool is to guide users through the creation of a climate adaptation plan by using a general approach. 
--> can you rework the most important ideas into a single intro sentence? it seems like the purpose of a creating a climate adaptatin plan should be front and center.

This tool provides a structured approachto help users considerevaluate the potential effectsimpacts of climate change on what . . . ? and design land management, conservation actions, and general future plan in regards to these and design a local adaptation plan to mitigate future impacts.  --> does this get at what you were trying to say here?The process is tailored to a variety of needs; Using a general framework that can be tailored to individual needs, this tool accomodates  therefore, it accommodates a wide variety of geographic locations, land ownership types, ecosystems and land uses, management goals, and project sizes.

This tool prompts users to look at soils, hydrology, temperature, and surrounding land use for the designated project site. --> does this user need to provide the data and tool assess vulnerability? or does the user need to complete their own assessment of these factors following a suggested protocol?

Though the tool guides users through the assessment and planning process, users are required to provide substantial input regarding present conditions, as well as potential vulnerabilities and changes that will affect the project going forward. These vulnerabilities include ones driven by climate change as well as land use changes. This tool can be used by one person, or as a collaborative project between multiple people. 

The tool gives users opportunity to create a custom adaptation plan, but the overall success of the project depends on the accuracy of the user’s data and their ability to design, implement, and monitor the project. This tool is moderately time intensive, however there are multiple resources and how to guides, including a YouTube channel and a 7-week online training course, to explain how to use and get the most out of this tool. 


**Relevance:** Addresses vulnerability and risk in climate design land management and conservation actions that can help prepare for changing conditions.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Foresters, Natural resources managers, Agriculturalists, Biologists, Planners, Soil conservationists, Consultants, Master Gardeners

**Strengths:** Allows user to create a site specific adaptation plan, Youtube channel explaining how to use Workbook, Site-specific guidance and results
