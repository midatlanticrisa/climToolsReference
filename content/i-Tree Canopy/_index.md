#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The i-Tree Canopy tool creates a custom canopy cover report and assess the benefits (or costs) of increasing or decreasing the canopy cover in a user-defined location. Using google earth imagery, users then must classify the cover type (i.e., tree, non-tree, water, etc.) at randomly distributed points within the study area. This information can be time consuming to collect; however, it can be used as in conjunction with i-Tree Eco, as the canopy cover input data.

**Relevance:** Trees sequester carbon, provide shade, and aid in storm water retention. Planting trees increases resiliency and helps mitigate climate change.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Non-governmental Organizations, Planners, Public, Homeowners/buyers, Real Estate Agents, Educators, Urban planners, Environmental Planners, Decision makers, Extension and Outreach Professionals, Foresters, Conservationalist, Community Officals, Community Leaders, Urban Foresters

**Strengths:** Option to upload shapefiles, Provides location specific scenarios, Series of explainer videos

**Limitations:** Requires knowledge of cover class, Accuracy depends on the users ability to correctly idenify cover class
