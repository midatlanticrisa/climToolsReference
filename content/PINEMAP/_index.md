#### Tool Summary
**Description:** PINEMAP contains 13 total tools dealing with loblolly pine trees in Southeastern US across four categories: Environment, Establishment, Management, and Production.

The USDA tool is focused on helping foresters understand how their pine forests will be effected by future climate, focusing on temperature and precipitation changes. Each tool in this network provides an interactive map, searchable by latitude and longitude, with layers of data for either historical observed, projected change, and a projected average. Time scale projections go as far in the future as the year 2099 and are available in 20-year increments. Two emissions scenarios are available. The low-effort tool is for use by beginner- to intermediate-level tool users.

**Relevance:** Pine trees influence their local climate yet are also themselves sensitive to climate factors including temperature and precipitation. The tools in the PINEMAP DSS use climate data and regional productivity models to explore the relationships between pine trees and climate.

**Scope:** Generalized

**Target Audience:** Agriculture *Conservationists *Extension and Outreach Professionals *Federal Agencies *Natural Resource Professionals *Public

**Strengths:** Multiple tools in one * Tools related to the general environment; establishment, management, and production of pine trees *Clear navigation and explination of tools

**Limitations:** Focused on a single species (loblolly) of pine *Limited resolution, Cannot compare maps simultaneously/side-by-side, annot easily download data
