#### Tool Summary
**Description:** Delaware Environmental Monitoring Sites is a data access portal that provides an inventory of environmental monitoring sites throughout the state of Delaware.

This tool provides access to over 400 meteorological, groundwater, tidal, and water quality monitoring sites in Delaware. Users can search for monitoring sites through an interactive map, table, or list of monitoring sites and filter sites of interest by many factors, such as type of site and/or measured variables. Selecting a site from the map view also provides a brief summary that includes the period of record, variables measured, and a source link to access data.

The monitoring sites linked through this data access portal vary widely in terms of content and structure; therefore data availability and downloads vary by site.

**Relevance:** A broad range of environmental monitoring factors are available through this tool in both near-real time and as historical data. This allows for monitoring real time conditions such as water quality, meteorological parameters, and weather conditions, and evaluating climate conditions over time.
