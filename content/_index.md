### Climate Tools:
#### a search engine for finding climate tools in the Mid-Atlantic

MARISA Climate Tools is a site designed to help you identify the best climate tool(s) for your needs in the Mid-Atlantic Region. Climate Tools helps speed up the time it takes to find a tool and helps you feel more confident in your choice of tool(s) by allowing you to filter a collection of tools based on your needs, view a summary of the available tools, and compare tools in a similar format.
 
There are many tools available that address climate change or other environmental issues. However, it takes time to find and sort through all of those tools and not all of them are described in the same way. It is easy to be unsure that the tool you have chosen is the best tool for your needs. Climate Tools is designed to help alleviate those issues.
 
Changes in our climate have become more apparent and important over time. Due to the scope of climate change, and its affects on human societies, it is difficult to collect, analyze, and communicate the results of an analysis without some helpful tools. Tools can help users incorporate climate information into their work to support water management, support planning, help educate users, visualize potential futures or scenarios, and characterize social, economic, and ecological benefits. Climate Tools helps you find the tools most helpful to you and your project that addresses changes in our climate.

To get started, head to the [Tool Search](/toolsearch/) page to start filtering the collection of tools based on your needs or head to the [Tools](/tools/) page to view the complete list of climate tools and summaries for each.

### Climate Tools
The changing climate of our world is one of the largest concerns of any generation. Due to the scope of climate change, and its affects on human societies, it would be almost impossible to collect, analyze, and communicate the results of an analysis without some helpful tools. However, not every tool is the same, and selecting the correct tool for your project can seem daunting.

### A Tool for Tools
This site is a service to help you choose the best available tool or tools for your needs. This site allows you to view a summary of the available climate tools, and compare the various tools in one similar format to help in the decision making process.
