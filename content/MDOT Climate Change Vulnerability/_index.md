#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The MDOT Climate Change Vulnerability tool is an interactive map that illustrates the potential impact of storm surge and sea level rise on roadways and transportation infrastructure in Maryland.

This tool is primarily intended to support MDOT State Highway Administration to avert potential impacts of sea level rise and storm surge on transportation infrastructure, but can also be applied by planners evaluating where a project may be threatened by rising water levels. The map layers are organized to address roadway flooding, general projected flood depth, and roadway incidents, enabling different target audiences to easily access relevant information. The data layers feature extensive projection scenarios, such as the roadway inundation layer which shows 10, 25, 50, 100, and 500-year storm events from 2015's observed sea level. This layer also shows the same storm event projections for 2050 and 2100. Users can also view past road closure events, including the location, date, and duration a road was closed dating as far back as 2011. The tool also shows FEMA Evacuation Routes, FEMA Effective Floodplains, and projected water depth grids. 

This map's water level projections are based on data from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Projections, United States Geological Survey (USGS) studies, and the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal observations.

**Relevance:** The affected areas increase in number and severity with time as climate change effects become more drastic.
