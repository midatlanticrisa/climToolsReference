#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Surging Seas Risk Zone Map (SSRZM) displays coastal areas predicted to experience the effects of sea level rise (SLR) within the U.S. The interactive map overlays allow the user to visualize the spatial extent of 1-10ft of SLR, while concurrently including risk factors such as population size, income, ethnicity, and infrastructural components. Users can refine the tool to exhibit specific scenarios, such as "Extreme Carbon Cuts" and "Unchecked pollution," which alter SLR values depending upon particular coastal localities. The SSRZM offers the NOAA extreme scenario 2100 (in which Antarctic ice loss is rapid), which is unlikely but increasingly plausible as a worst case scenario option.

Additionally, the SSRZM generates "City Stats" that provide the user with a localized compository report of the map findings. City Stats also include a number of figures for comparing scenarios expressed on the map that focus specifically on the flood risk timeline and social vulnerabilities.

**Relevance:** flooding due to climate-change-driven sea level rise.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Community officials, Planners, Public, Decision makers, Real estate agents, Homeowners, Public

**Strengths:** Extensive data layers, Visual for SLR extent, Multiple scenarios, Local fact sheets, Offers range of solutions

**Limitations:** Certain layers will not display on large scale areas (I need a better way of saying that you can see it if it's too zoomed out), Limited mobile features
