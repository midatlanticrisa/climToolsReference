Developed By: NOAA, and MARISA

**Summary:** Climate Data for the Mid-Atlantic Region contains a list and overview of climate data products in the region. 

Available data include an experimental precipitation dataset developed by MARISA researchers (ChexWX) as well as a variety of additional gridded temperature and precipitation data including: Daymet, Livneh, METDATA, nClimGrid, and PRISM.  Theses datasets are useful for looking at historical climate data, but do not include data for current or future climate projections. This tool is intended for advanced users with experience working with gridded data.
