**Summary:** The i-Tree Design tool is a comprehensive tool that allows users to estimate the benefits of individual and groups of trees. By entering the location of tree species in an interactive map, users can view the current and future benefits provided by that tree. This tree placement data is compiled into a report which also provides the current and future (20 years) economic benefits of those trees.
