**Summary:** i-Tree Eco is designed to use field-collected tree cover data along with local hourly air pollution and meteorological data to quantify forest structure, environmental benefits of trees, and economic value of these trees to communities. Though beneficial for specific projects and experts in forestry and land management, i-Tree Eco is not intended for everyday users. i-Tree Eco is a more time intensive and complex tool on i-Tree. It requires a downloadable software application.
