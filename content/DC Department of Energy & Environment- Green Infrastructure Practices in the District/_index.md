#### Tool Summary
**Description:** This interactive mapping tool displays locations within Washington D.C. that have installed Green Infrastructure (GI) practices.  

The Green Infrastructure Practices map displays common Best Management Practices (BMP) that manage stormwater runoff throughout the District, such as green roofs and rainwater harvesting systems. The map distinguishes the extent of the three watersheds within the District, displays practices eligible for Stormwater Retention Credits (SRC), and recognizes buildings that have a Green Roof Rebate. These features enable decision makers and homeowners alike to plan for environmentally conscious development and recognize where GI has been implemented. Users can view the data from "Layers" in GIS, and all data is available for download from http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/best-management-practices.

**Relevance:** provides a spatial log of green infrastructure that decision makers and homeowners can use to plan additional BMP projects

**Scope:** Locality

**Target Audience:** Decision Makers, Community Leaders, Planners, Homeowners, Environmental Planner, State Agencies

**Strengths:** Ability to view different layers, Mobile access, Site specific data, Ability to search by location, Downloadable data

**Limitations:** Cannot view some layers simultaneously, No glossary for GI's, Info Summary does not generate data
