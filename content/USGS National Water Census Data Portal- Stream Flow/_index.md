#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The USGS National Water Census Data Portal Stream flow tool allows users to address stream flow averages for a specific locality, if a nearby stream gage is available. 

This tool helps users assess stream flow frequency, magnitude, duration, and timing of stream flow.  Observed streamflow can be viewed in plots and additional data and statistics are easily exported. Calculated statistics are clearly explained and useful for assessment. This tool provides the option to view two locations simultaneously in order to assessed statistics side by side. The tool is limited by where gages are present, but when gages are present they provide useful data. Data collection ranges from 1950 to present day and varies by gage. This data can also be calculated through a corresponding R package provided in the portal.

**Relevance:** Increased storms increase streamflow, can assess trends over time

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** fill out

**Strengths:** Wide range of statistics, Data easily exported, Site-specific results

**Limitations:** Limited to location of gages, Does not provide future projections
