#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Prioritization Tool from Natureâ€™s Network is an interactive mapping tool that helps identify conservation priorities, such as rare and threatened habitats for species of greatest conservation need with the goal of providing local planners a broad, regional context for  areas of degraded habitat that, if restored, would contribute to a network of connected, intact, and resilient sites.
--> can you break this up a bit, or remove less important details. As is, this sentence in kind of long and hard to follow. A good rule of thumb for science writing, particularly for public audiences is to aim for "short and punch" sentences. 

The tool allows users to build custom models using a catalog of nearly 400 metrics as well as display pre-designed prioritization maps for already defined scenarios. --> what types of models? habitat suitability? habitat distribution? something else?

The user selects the geography in which they want to build the model and then selects as many pertinent metrics as desired from four categories: Ecological, Species, Land Use, and Conservation. While the tool focuses on conservation, many metrics, such as individual species' climate response, and climatic change impacts such as change in degree days, incorporate --> this sentence seems incomplete . . . 

The user can also specify a weight for each metric and assign it a positive or negative value. --> can you elaborate on the purpose of assigning weights, what exactly are you generating a score for?

It takes between 30-60 seconds for the tool to generate the result, whereupon the user can go back and change parameters or weights to create new models for comparison. While the interactive mapping function is currently not working for the custom models, --> if this function isn't working, it probably makes sense to describe it in such detail. You should instead focus on the predefined models, and then maybe add a note about option to develop custom models, though it may not be working at this time. 

the user can view an interactive map for the pre-defined scenarios, found on the main tool page. Users can also save the custom models and will receive a code that allows them to use them in the future. A pdf of the map and .csv file of the data and model can be downloaded on the tool as well.


**Relevance:** includes metrics related to climate change, such as salt marsh migration, climate response for multiple species, and degree days

**Scope:** State

**Target Audience:** Community Officials, Community Leaders, Conservationists, Decisionmakers, Environmental Agencies, Environmental Consultant, Environmental Planner, Restoration Specialists

**Strengths:** Easy-to-use, interactive interface, Ability to compare locations, Flexible process can be applied to develop multiple models, Welcome guide/tutorials, Extensive datasets provide for wide range of analysis, 

**Limitations:** does not provide future projections, no ability to input additional data, interactive mapping feature does not work
