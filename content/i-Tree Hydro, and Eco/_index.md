#### Tool Summary
**Description:** i-Tree Hydro models urban hydrology from a vegetation-specific perspective by simulating the effects of changes in urban tree cover and impervious surfaces on the hydrological cycle. This includes streamflow and water quality, for both watershed and non-watershed areas. Though beneficial for specific projects and experts in forestry and land management, i-Tree Eco and Hydro are not intended for everyday users.

i-Tree Eco and Hydro are the most time intensive and complex tools on i-Tree. Both tools require a downloadable software application. i-Tree Eco is designed to use field-collected tree cover data along with local hourly air pollution and meteorological data to quantify forest structure, environmental benefits of trees, and economic value of these trees to communities.

**Relevance:** Trees sequester carbon, provide shade, and aid in stormwater retention. Planting trees increases resiliency and helps mitigate climate change.
