#### Tool Summary
**Description:** i-Tree Eco and Hydro are the most time intensive and complex tools on i-Tree. Both tools require a downloadable software application. i-Tree Eco is designed to use field-collected tree cover data along with local hourly air pollution and meteorological data to quantify forest structure, environmental benefits of trees, and economic value of these trees to communities.

i-Tree Hydro models urban hydrology from a vegetation specific perspective by simulating the effects of changes in urban tree cover and impervious surfaces on the hydrological cycle. This includes streamflow and water quality, for both watershed and non-watershed areas. Though beneficial for specific projects and experts in forestry and land management, i-Tree Eco and Hydro are not intended for everyday users.

**Relevance:** Trees sequester carbon, provide shade, and aid in storm water retention. Planting trees increases resiliency and helps mitigate climate change.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Non-governmental Organizations, Planners, Urban planners, Environmental Planners, Decision makers, Extension and Outreach Professionals, Foresters, Conservationalist, Community Officials, Community Leaders, Urban Foresters

**Strengths:** Series of explainer videos, , 

**Limitations:** Requires downloadable software, Not compatable with Mac/iOS software
