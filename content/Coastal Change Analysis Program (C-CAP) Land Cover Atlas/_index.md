#### Tool Summary
**Description:** The Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Land Cover Atlas is an interactive mapping tool that allows user to view changes in coastal land cover from 1996-2010 throughout the US. 

This easy-to-use tool provides access to coastal land cover and land cover change data developed by NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). Through the interactive mapping tool, users can view classified land cover data dating back to 1996. Users can also analyze local changes in land cover by watershed or county and choose from general, developed, forest, and wetland land use change. --> can you be more specific about what you mean by choose here?

Alongside the maps the land use change, the C-CAP Land Cover Atlas also includes numerical summaries of trends, such as loss of forests new development, and increases in impervious surfaces. This tool strives to make land cover data accessible to users who do not have advanced skills or experience with GIS.
--> do you think this tool is actually easy to use? if so, definitely just say that a little more directly. 

Can also add a sentence or two about exports? It seems like there is a decent report export option, as well as other ways to share maps and download data.

**Relevance:** Changes to land cover can amplify or mitigate the effects of climate change. Knowing how land use cover has changed in a locality can help inform resiliece and adaptation planning, especially in coastal regions.

**Scope:** National

**Target Audience:** Community Officials, Decisionmakers, Environmental Planner, Extension and Outreach Professionals, Homeowners/buyers, Public

**Strengths:** Easy-to-use interface, Option to export data raw data, Option to view data by watershed

**Limitations:** Limited to coastal regions, Data only available until 2010 for specific years, Does not provide future projections
