**Developed By:** DDNREC_Division of Energy & Climate

**Summary:** The Delaware Climate Change Projections Portal allows users to easily find and download downscaled climate projection data for the state of Delaware.  

The climate projections provided by this tool were generated from 13 different climate model runs conducted for the Delaware Climate Change Impact Assessment. Each model was run for both low- (RCP 4.5) and high-emissions (RCP 8.5) scenarios, and statistically downscaled to 14 Delaware weather stations with long-term historical records. The projections include a variety of climate metrics such as average temperature, precipitation intensity, and growing season length, as well as temperature and precipitation extremes. For each metric, users can view and download plots of observed and projected values, as well as the underlying data. The portal provides excellent documentation of methods and term definitions. This tool is engaging for audiences with varied skill levels. The climate projection plots are a great resource for beginner users and the underlying data may be useful for more advanced users looking to do further analysis.
