**Summary:** The Bay Footprint Calculator is an easy-to-use tool that estimates your contribution to nitrogen pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. 

By providing simple lifestyle information such as diet, housing, and transportation, the Bay Footprint Calculator estimates how much nitrogen you contribute annually to Chesapeake Bay. Nitrogen pollution harms the Bay by contributing to algal blooms that use up oxygen, creating "dead zones" that harm other plants and wildlife. To see how much you contribute to the Bay's deadzone, this tool calculates your annual total nitrogen contribution and grades your estimated impact compared to other individuals. The calculator also provides a chart to show exactly what aspects of your lifestyle use the most nitrogen and ranks your score against the average person. Users must input their email address to view their results and receive a tailored chart outlining the sources of nitrogen contribution. Users also have the option to share their score on Facebook or Twitter to see how you compare to your friends and neighbors. 

Another helpful output of this tool is the final report that offers easy solutions to limit your Bay Footprint, such as eating less meat, and using a rain barrel at your home. This is an excellent tool for gauging your personal impact on such a valuable natural resource as the Chesapeake Bay.
