**Summary:** Targeted Subwatersheds is a simple mapping tool that displays watershed boundaries, TMDL subwatersheds targeted for Waste Load Allocation (WLA) prioritization, as well as the D.C. combined sewer area and MS4 area. 

The purpose of this map is to show the overlap of the subwatersheds and combined sewer system. Users can print the map or export a table of the watershed/sewer boundary locations.
