**Developed By:** USGS

**Summary:** The USGS Geo Data Portal (GDP) is designed for advanced users looking to access meteorological, climate, and urban growth data at national and regional scales. 

This tool allows users to easily subset and summarize large or complex data by performing data processing online, decreasing the computational power typically required to download and process data. By allowing users to download only the subset of data they need, this tool can reduce data sent to the user by nearly 90%. 

In addition to downloading the data directly through the portal, users can also access and interact with the data through Python and R packages. The GDP provides a brief description of each data source and the variables available for processing. After selecting a data source, the GDP then prompts the user to define their area of interest and select specific variables as well as an algorithm to process the data.
