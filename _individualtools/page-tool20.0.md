**Summary:** The MARISA Climate Impacts Summary and Outlook Reports are a quarterly series summarizing seasonal weather and climate trends and forecasts for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

Released seasonally, these reports summarize recent weather events in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed and provide a forecast for the upcoming season. Each report describes recent significant weather events, seasonal temperature and precipitation, a seasonal weather forecast, and an analysis of long-term trends and climate projection. Figures and charts illustrating the data are clearly explained, as well as potential implications of weather forecasts and trends.
